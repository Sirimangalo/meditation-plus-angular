  <p>
    Meditation+ is a companion app for our online community at <a href="http://meditation.sirimangalo.org/">meditation.sirimangalo.org</a>. It is meant to provide all the functionality of the website in a format more suited to a mobile device.
  </p>

  <h4>Basic Usage</h4>
  <p>
    After creating a username and password, you are presented with three tabs: Meditation, Chat, and Commit.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>The meditation tab</b> allows you to submit a meditation session to the server and view sessions currently in progress. The list of sessions also shows recently completed sessions below active ones. Above the list there is a graph with the numbers 0-23 below it. The numbers represent hours of the day, and the current hour by UTC standard time is highlighted in yellow. The green bar graphs represent total minutes of meditation per hour (UTC) for the last month, meant to give an idea of when you are most likely to find other meditators online. Above this, there is a list of users currently (within the past minute) active on either the main site or the Android app. Clicking on a person's username will open their profile page.
  </p>

  <p>
    A hidden "easter egg" of sorts can be accessed once you have completed a meditation session but it is still listed as completed (recently completed sessions last for one hour in the list). Long-click on the "Send" button, and your status will change to a heart, meant to signify that you are sending metta (loving-kindness). Long-clicking again will change you status back.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>The chat tab</b> allows you to interact with other meditators. The <b>:)</b> button opens a box with various emoticons. Double-clicking on the input area clears the input text. Clicking on the username in the chat list will open that person's profile. When another tab is active, this tab's title will show the number of new chats since the chat tab was last active.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>The commit tab</b> allows you sign up for various commitments or create your own for others to join. Clicking on a commitment title will show details and buttons to commit/uncommit, edit or delete the commitment. The plus button in the top right creates a new commitment; the other buttons in each commitment perform the functions mentioned. If you are signed up for a commitment, its colour will change from red to green depending on your level of fulfillment. A message near the bottom of the commitment will also let you know your percentage of fulfilment.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are two main types of commitment: total and repeat. Total commitments require a certain number of minutes within a certain period of time (one day, one week, one month, or one year). Fulfilment of this type of commitment is measured for the period ending at current time. Repeat commitments require a certain number of minutes walking and sitting on a specific day and possibly time. Fulfilment is measured according to sessions started after five minutes prior the scheduled time and before one hour after the scheduled time.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>The menu button</b> performs various functions depending on where you are in the app. From the main activity, it allows you to open your own profile, go to the How To Meditate page on our site, log out, change basic settings, and view this help page.
